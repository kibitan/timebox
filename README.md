# timebox

Timebox is an Event Sourcing reference implementation, written in Go. Included is a simple Event Store and APIs for composing very basic Event Sourced services. It can either serve as the foundation for something bigger, or serve as an example of some key concepts. It is not, however, a stand-alone framework.
